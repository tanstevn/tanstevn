## Hi there 👋

It's a pleasure to have you in my GitHub profile! I'm a Software Developer that loves to work on C# written backend projects. Whenever I have free time, I used to add something into my `in practice` to gain more knowledge and develop my skills.

💻 I'm proficient in both C# and JavaScript/TypeScript for backend development and both JavaScript and TypeScript frontend development.  
🔭 I'm currently investing my time to my personal project called GovConnect and LoanMe that are both ASP.NET Core Web API application on the server-side and targets React Next.js on the client-side.  
🌱 I’m constantly adopting and improving my knowledge and skills in **Software Development**, **Software Architecture/Design**, and **AWS/Azure**.  
📫 How to reach me: You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-lester-tan-113007157/) profile or notify me through my email at tanstevenlester@gmail.com.
